# North American Paleoclimate Database

This project is designed to be an access point for North American paleoclimate records. Built using the global database compiled by [Kaufman et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3) and operationalizd by [Routson and McKay](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_multiproxy_database_of_western_North_American_Holocene_paleoclimate_records/12863843/2), this codebase will alow for server deployment and visual evaluation of the records.
